  Container 笔记：
  <li><b>Engine</b> - Representation of the entire Catalina servlet engine,
      most likely containing one or more subcontainers that are either Host
      or Context implementations, or other custom groups.
  <li><b>Host</b> - Representation of a virtual host containing a number
      of Contexts.
  <li><b>Context</b> - Representation of a single ServletContext, which will
      typically contain one or more Wrappers for the supported servlets.
  <li><b>Wrapper</b> - Representation of an individual servlet definition
      (which may support multiple servlet instances if the servlet itself
      implements SingleThreadModel).
